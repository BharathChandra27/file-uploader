# File Uploader
 A sample application to upload files in express using multer. I used materialize framework for front-end and ejs as template engine in back-end.

 Use the below command to install all the dependecies

``` npm install --save  ```

 Use this command to run the server

``` npm run start ```

 After successfully running the server you can able to upload any image with **jpeg | jpg | png | gif** extension. And you can see all the uploaded files in **public/uploads** directory.
